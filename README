The current revision of the code accepts values from a LabVIEW GUI frontend and passes them over a serial USB interface to an Arduino connected to a fiber tapering device.  The only user configuration needed for the GUI is setting the serial port used by the Arduino USB-serial interface.

This is the final revision of the semester, no further changes will be made explicitly as part of the Senior Design project class.

This is code to drive a fiber tapering device as created for the Spring 2011 batch of senior design projects at Southern Methodist University.

Code assumes the use of a continuous rotation servo on digital pin 9 of the arduino board (Arduino Uno) as well as a custom fiber tapering device (although the algorithms should be portable).


Feel free to e-mail (project owner's username) at gmail dot com for details on the setup if you would like to create a fiber tapering device using our specifications.
